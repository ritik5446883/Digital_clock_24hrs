# Digital_clock_24hrs
This project involves the design and implementation of a 24-hour format digital alarm clock using Multisim software. The digital clock displays hours and minutes, and includes two buttons for resetting the minutes and hours individually. The alarm feature allows users to set and activate an alarm for a specific time.
